# What is this?

`chrome-headless-lambda-linux-x64.tar.gz` was created on a Linux machine. It contains [Headless Chrome](https://cs.chromium.org/chromium/src/headless/app/) binaries specific to the [Lambda execution environment](http://docs.aws.amazon.com/lambda/latest/dg/current-supported-versions.html). The tarball is used during the Serverless deployment/packaging step to create the zip file for deploying the function to Lambda.


## Building Headless Chrome for AWS Lambda

How to build headless_shell (headless Chrome) for the lambda execution environment. These steps are based on [this](http://www.zackarychapple.guru/chrome/2016/08/24/chrome-headless.html) and [this](https://chromium.googlesource.com/chromium/src/+/master/docs/linux_build_instructions.md).

1. Create a new EC2 instance using the community AMI with name amzn-ami-hvm-2016.03.3.x86_64-gp2 (us-west-2 ami-7172b611).
2. Pick an Instance Type with at least 16 GB of memory. Compile time will take about 4-5 hours on a t2.xlarge, or 2-3ish on a t2.2xlarge or about 45 min on a c4.4xlarge.
3. Give yourself a Root Volume that's at least 30 GB (40 GB if you want to compile a debug buildâ€”which you won't be able to upload to Lambda because it's too big.)
4. SSH into the new instance and run:

```bash
sudo -s

printf "LANG=en_US.utf-8\nLC_ALL=en_US.utf-8" >> /etc/environment

yum install -y git redhat-lsb python bzip2 tar pkgconfig atk-devel alsa-lib-devel bison binutils brlapi-devel bluez-libs-devel bzip2-devel cairo-devel cups-devel dbus-devel dbus-glib-devel expat-devel fontconfig-devel freetype-devel gcc-c++ GConf2-devel glib2-devel glibc.i686 gperf glib2-devel gtk2-devel gtk3-devel java-1.*.0-openjdk-devel libatomic libcap-devel libffi-devel libgcc.i686 libgnome-keyring-devel libjpeg-devel libstdc++.i686 libX11-devel libXScrnSaver-devel libXtst-devel libxkbcommon-x11-devel ncurses-compat-libs nspr-devel nss-devel pam-devel pango-devel pciutils-devel pulseaudio-libs-devel zlib.i686 httpd mod_ssl php php-cli python-psutil wdiff --enablerepo=epel
exit
```

You need to elevate priviledges before the printf because the `>>` redirect by default is performed by the current user and can't be elevated by an inline sudo. 

_Yum_ will complain about some packages not existing. Whatever. I haven't looked into them. Didn't seem to stop me from building headless_shell, though. Ignore whiney little _Yum_ and move on. Next:

```bash
git clone https://chromium.googlesource.com/chromium/tools/depot_tools.git
echo "export PATH=$PATH:$HOME/depot_tools" >> ~/.bash_profile
source ~/.bash_profile
mkdir Chromium && cd Chromium
fetch --no-history chromium
cd src
```
**NOTE** If you need to compile a specific chromium version and not just the HEAD then you must not use `--no-history` and use `fetch chromium` instead.
If you have already fetched without history you can unshallow the repository by running `git fetch --unshallow` 

**TODO:** add part here about modifying Chrome to not use /dev/shm. See here: https://groups.google.com/a/chromium.org/d/msg/headless-dev/qqbZVZ2IwEw/CPInd55OBgAJ


```bash
mkdir -p out/Headless
echo 'import("//build/args/headless.gn")' > out/Headless/args.gn
echo 'is_debug = false' >> out/Headless/args.gn
echo 'symbol_level = 0' >> out/Headless/args.gn
echo 'is_component_build = false' >> out/Headless/args.gn
echo 'remove_webcore_debug_symbols = true' >> out/Headless/args.gn
echo 'enable_nacl = false' >> out/Headless/args.gn
gn gen out/Headless
ninja -C out/Headless headless_shell
```

make the tarball:
```bash
mkdir out/headless-chrome && cd out
cp Headless/headless_shell Headless/libosmesa.so headless-chrome/
tar -zcvf chrome-headless-lambda-linux-x64.tar.gz headless-chrome/
```

```
scp -i path/to/your/key-pair.pem ec2-user@<the-instance-public-ip>:/home/ec2-user/Chromium/src/out/chrome-headless-lambda-linux-x64.tar.gz ./
```


**TODO:** We don't need `libosmesa.so` cuz we're not using the GPU? See here: https://groups.google.com/a/chromium.org/d/msg/headless-dev/qqbZVZ2IwEw/XMKlEMP3EQAJ


## Updating 

Instructions based on https://www.chromium.org/developers/how-tos/get-the-code/working-with-release-branches

```bash
git fetch --tags
git checkout -b name_for_your_branch tags/XX.X.XXXX.X
gclient sync --with_branch_heads # This step will fail if you have not fetched the full history
# The rest of the steps are as above
mkdir -p out/Headless
echo 'import("//build/args/headless.gn")' > out/Headless/args.gn
echo 'is_debug = false' >> out/Headless/args.gn
echo 'symbol_level = 0' >> out/Headless/args.gn
echo 'is_component_build = false' >> out/Headless/args.gn
echo 'remove_webcore_debug_symbols = true' >> out/Headless/args.gn
echo 'enable_nacl = false' >> out/Headless/args.gn
gn gen out/Headless
ninja -C out/Headless headless_shell
```
**NOTE:** Replace XX.X.XXXX.X with the exact release tag you want
